Description: The aim of {pico} is to set up a skeleton directory with the 
    absolute minimum requirements for an R package. This is a curio to
    demonstrate the bare bones of package requirements; it might be useful for
    intimidated R users who are creating packages for the very first time, but
    is not intended for 'serious' package development.
